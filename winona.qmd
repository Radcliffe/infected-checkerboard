## The infected checkerboard

* An infection spreads among the squares of an $n \times n$ board.
* If a square has two or more infected neighbors, it becomes infected itself.
* How many squares are needed to infect the entire board?

Four squares suffice to infect the entire board.

. . .

But can we do it with only three squares?

## One word: PERIMETER!

* Consider the perimeter of the infected regions.
* Square infected by 2 neighbors $\implies$ perimeter unchanged.
* Square infected by $> 2$ neighbors $\implies$ perimeter decreases.

* So the perimeter never increases! (It's a *monovariant*.)

## But...

* The perimeter of the entire $n \times n$ board is $4n$.
* If fewer than $n$ squares are infected, then the perimeter
of the infected region is less than $4n$.
* Therefore, the $n \times n$ board cannot be infected by
fewer than $n$ squares.

## Variation on a theme

Suppose that a square needs three infected neighbors
to become infected.

What is the smallest number of infected cells that can
infect an $m \times n$ board?

## An invariant

* Let $s = \#$  of infected squares

* Let $a = \#$ of pairs of adjacent squares

* Let $b = \#$ of uninfected regions that
are surrounded by infected squares

![](figs/fig-06-01.png){height=400 fig-align="center"}


## An invariant

* When a square is infected by three of its neighbors,
  $a$ increases by 3, but $b$ does not change.
* When a square is infected by four of its neighbors,
  $a$ increases by 4, and $b$ decreases by 1.
* In both cases, the quantity $J \equiv 3s - a - b$ does not change.

## Lower bound

Suppose that an initial infection of $s_0$ squares
spreads to the entire $m \times n$ board.

* $s$ increases from $s_0$ to $mn$.

* $a$ increases from $a_0$ to $m(n-1) + (m-1)n$.

* $b$ decreases from $b_0$ to 0, or remains at 0.

Therefore,
$$
\begin{align*}
J &= 3s_0 - a_0 - b_0 = mn + m + n \\
&\implies s_0 \ge \frac{mn + n + n}{3}, \\
& \text{with equality when } a_0 = b_0 = 0.
\end{align*}
$$

## Pandemic formula

Suppose that an initial set of $s$ squares
will infect an $m \times n$ grid. Then

$$s = \frac13 (mn + m + n + a + c),$$

where

* $a$ is the number of adjacent pairs of infected squares, and
* $b$ is the number of uninfected regions that are surrounded
on all sides by infected squares.
