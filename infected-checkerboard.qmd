## The infected checkerboard

The following problem is from Mathematical Puzzles: A Connoisseur’s Collection by Peter Winkler.


> An infection spreads among the squares of an n × n checkerboard in the following manner. If a square has two or more infected neighbors, it becomes infected itself. Prove that you cannot infect the whole board if you begin with fewer than n infected squares.


## n squares are sufficient

You can infect the whole board if you begin with $n$ infected squares.  (Why?)

## n squares are necessary

You cannot infect the whole board if you begin with fewer than
$n$ infected squares. (Why not?)

. . .

*Hint: Consider the perimeter of the infected region.*

. . .

* If there are fewer than $n$ infected squares, the 
perimeter of the infected region is less than the perimeter
of the whole board.

. . .

* When a new square is infected, the perimeter of the infected
region decreases or stays the same.

. . .

* So the infected region can never cover the entire board.


## Bootstrap percolation

* This process is called *2-neighbor bootstrap percolation*.

* It's an example of a cellular automaton.

* The process can be defined on any undirected graph.

**NEW QUESTION**

Suppose that a square needs three or more infected
neighbors to become infected itself. What is the minimum
number of squares that must be initially infected in order
to infect an $m \times n$ grid?

## The pandemic formula

Suppose that an initial set of $s$ squares
will infect an $m \times n$ grid. Then

$$s = \frac{mn + m + n + a + c}{3}$$

where

* $a$ is the number of adjacent pairs of infected squares, and
* $c$ is the number of "islands" of uninfected squares.

## Perfect initial sets

Suppose that an initial set of $s$ squares will infect an
$m \times n$ grid. Then

$$s \ge \frac{mn + m + n}{3}.$$

If
$$\displaystyle s = \frac{mn + m + n}{3}$$
then we say that the initial set is **perfect**.

## Infinite family of perfect initial sets

## Main results

* The only perfect initial sets are the infinite families
described previously.

* If $m, n \ge 4$, the minimum number of squares $s$
needed to infect an $m \times n$ grid satisfies

$$ \frac{mn + m + n}{3} \le s \le 
\frac{mn + m + n + 6}{3}.$$

* In most cases I have found exact lower bounds.
